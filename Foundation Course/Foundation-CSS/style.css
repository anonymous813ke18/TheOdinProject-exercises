Notes:
1. I had this doubt, I am not setting and height of width inside
    any of the child containers (child or grandchild), then how is
    it that the children are filling up the space inside the parent
    containers? Well, the answer is pretty simple actually, by default
    the children are bunched up at the start of the container on the 
    primary axis, and they will stretch out to the fill the entire 
    container on the cross-axis. Now, we are making a change to the 
    primary axis behaviour when we set 'flex: 1', we are saying the 
    children can GROW to fill up the available space, and the space 
    will be distributed propotionally between the children (flex items).
    We are also telling that the items can shrink when needed, but that's
    not the focus rn.
